Being part of the ER crew, he can’t hide his medical expertise and keeps saving lives, even if ‘unofficially’. He only wants one thing — to legally practice medicine again.\n\nThe life of the ER station consists of dramatic and often unconventional medical cases and tumultuous relationships inside the team. The characters’ life stories are troubled, but love heals all their wounds. Meetings and goodbyes, parents and children, personal dramas: it’s all connected in the show while the characters look for and find ways out of the most challenging professional and romantic situations.",

It is a Polish version of the Hungarian \"Barátok közt\".\n\nThe series is shot almost entirely in Warsaw and produced by the Polish branch of Freemantle Media. On 9 September 2008 it celebrated its 1000th episode; \"Na Wspólnej\" was the fourth Polish television series ever to achieve such status. A special episode was broadcast in which characters from some other of TVN's most popular shows visited Wspólna Street.",
